Personal Awesome Configuration
==============================

This is my awesome configuration how i use it.

Requirements:
-------------

* [Vicious](http://git.sysphere.org/vicious/)
* [iotd](http://github.com/sri-arjuna/iotd) (NASA its 'Image of the Day' as wallpaper)
* bash (required by 'iotd' and some other scripts)
* feh (used by 'iotd' to set wallpaper)

Images and Icons
----------------
The file: ./img/wallpapers/arch_fhd.png is not made by me.
It was shared at http://bbs.archlinux.org, sadly i dont recall where from the forum exactly.
Hope i get by that post or thread again.

The icons and images used were gathered from a free icon collection found on github.
