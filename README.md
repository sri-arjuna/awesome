Images and Icons
----------------
The file: img/arch_fhd.png is not made by me.
It was shared at http://bbs.archlinux.org, sadly i dont recall where from the forum exactly.
Hope i get by that post or thread again.

The icons and images used were gathered from a free icon collection found on github.
